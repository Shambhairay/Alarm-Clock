# Alarm-Clock using Vanilla JavaScript

This repository contains the code for an Alarm Clock developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of this project is to create a soothing experience with powerful features and a clean interface.

## Problem Statement

Create an alarm clock using ONLY vanilla JavaScript, with no libraries or frameworks allowed for JavaScript (you can use any CSS framework like Bootstrap).

## Features Required

### Clock Face

- Display the current time with the clock face updating in real-time (seconds, minutes, hours).

### Set Alarm

- Provide input boxes to set an alarm (hour, minute, second, AM/PM).
- Once the user sets the time and clicks the "Set Alarm" button, add that alarm to the alarms list below.
- When the alarm goes off, use the JavaScript `alert` function to notify the user.

### Alarms List

- Display a list of all alarms set by the user.

### Delete Alarm

- Provide a delete button for each alarm to remove it from the list.
- Ensure that deleting an alarm does not trigger an alert.
